## Introduction

GTKinter is designed to simplify the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. By wrapping the GTK toolkit, GTKinter enables developers to build rich desktop applications quickly. Whether you're creating a simple utility or a complex application, GTKinter provides the tools you need.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: GTKinter works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy to Use**: With a straightforward API, developers can create GUIs without extensive experience in GUI programming.
- **Customizable Widgets**: GTKinter offers a variety of widgets, including buttons, labels, and text boxes, which can be easily customized.
- **Responsive Design**: Applications built with GTKinter can adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Active Community**: Join a growing community of developers who share knowledge and support each other.

## Installation

To get started with GTKinter, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Amitdewangan2003/gtkinter/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it to install GTKinter.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- GTK 3.0 or higher

### Install GTK and Python

#### For Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-gtk-3
```

#### For Windows:

1. Download and install Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Use the Windows installer for GTK from the [GTK website](https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php).

#### For macOS:

Use Homebrew to install Python and GTK:

```bash
brew install python
brew install gtk+3
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can create a simple application to test GTKinter. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
import gtk

def hello_world(widget):
    print("Hello, World!")

window = gtk.Window()
window.connect("destroy", gtk.main_quit)

button = gtk.Button("Click Me")
button.connect("clicked", hello_world)
window.add(button)

window.show_all()
gtk.main()
```

## Usage

GTKinter provides a rich set of features for creating desktop applications. Here are some common tasks you can perform:

### Creating Windows

You can create a window with a title and dimensions:

```python
window = gtk.Window()
window.set_title("My GTK Application")
window.set_size_request(400, 300)
```

### Adding Widgets

Add various widgets to your application:

```python
label = gtk.Label("Welcome to GTKinter!")
button = gtk.Button("Exit")
```

### Handling Events

Respond to user actions with event handlers:

```python
def on_button_click(widget):
    print("Button clicked!")

button.connect("clicked", on_button_click)
```
